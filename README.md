# BBA Network — digital marketplace

A storefront for selling printable reference guides as digital downloads. Next.js on
Cloudflare Workers, Stripe Checkout, PDFs generated from markdown and served from R2,
and an agent fleet that researches the market, refreshes listings and verifies
releases on a schedule.

```
content/products/*.md  →  catalog/generated.json  →  PDFs + storefront + Stripe
        the notes            one merged artefact         three outputs, one source
```

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local        # fill in the Stripe keys and a signing secret
npm run catalog:check             # is the source sound? fails loudly if not
npm run catalog:build             # notes + prices → catalog/generated.json
npm run pdf:build                 # → private/downloads/*.pdf (A4 + US Letter)
npm run dev                       # → http://localhost:3000
```

To take a real test payment, run the Stripe CLI in a second terminal so webhooks reach
you, and paste the `whsec_...` it prints into `.env.local`:

```bash
npm run stripe:listen
```

Then buy something with card `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC.

## How it fits together

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `content/products/*.md` | **The source of truth.** One note per product: frontmatter, the printable pages, and the marketplace listing copy. |
| `catalog/products.json` | Commercial metadata only — price, display order, icon, accent. |
| `catalog/generated.json` | Built artefact merging the two. Committed; never edited by hand. |
| `scripts/validate-catalog.mjs` | Checks the source against a schema and fails the build. Run first. |
| `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` | Parses the notes and merges. Prints warnings you should read. |
| `scripts/build-pdfs.mjs` | Renders each note to A4 and US Letter via headless Chromium. |
| `scripts/stripe-sync.mjs` | Pushes the catalogue to Stripe, idempotently. Dry run by default. |
| `app/` | The storefront. Server components throughout, one client component. |
| `lib/download-token.ts` | Signed, expiring download links. |
| `private/downloads/` | Generated PDFs. Outside `public/` on purpose. |
| `lib/storage.ts` | Reads product files from R2 on Workers, from disk locally. |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare bindings and config. |
| `.claude/` | Subagents, workflows and slash commands — see [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md). |

## How delivery works

There is **no orders database**. Stripe is the order record, and entitlement is
derived from the Checkout Session every time.

1. A buyer pays. Stripe redirects to `/success?session_id=...`.
2. The success page retrieves the session, confirms it is paid, and mints HMAC-signed
   download links valid for 72 hours.
3. `/api/download` re-checks all three gates before streaming a byte: valid unexpired
   signature, Stripe still reports the session paid, and that session's entitlements
   include the requested file.
4. The webhook emails the same links, if `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured. Without it the
   store still works — the success page is the delivery route.

A refunded order stops working on its own, because gate 2 is checked live rather than
trusted from a stored flag.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build (runs `catalog:build` first) |
| `npm test` | Unit tests — parser, tokens, entitlements, catalogue integrity |
| `npm run catalog:check` | Validate the notes and prices before anything is generated |
| `npm run catalog:build` | Rebuild `catalog/generated.json` from the notes |
| `npm run pdf:build` | Rebuild the product PDFs |
| `npm run pdf:check` | Verify every PDF matches the page count its listing promises |
| `npm run pdf:upload` | Upload the PDFs to R2 (`-- --local` to seed the dev bucket) |
| `npm run stripe:sync` | Dry-run the Stripe catalogue sync (`-- --apply` to write) |
| `npm run cf:preview` | Run the real Workers runtime locally |
| `npm run cf:deploy` | Build and deploy to Cloudflare |
| `npm run workflows:check` | Validate the agent workflow scripts |
| `npm run agents:bootstrap` | Clone the reference repos into `vendor/` |

## Agents

Five GitHub Actions run the fleet on a schedule — market intelligence weekly, revenue
digest weekly, listing refresh monthly, release check on tags, and `@claude` mentions
on issues and PRs. Nothing writes to live Stripe or changes a price without a human.

Read [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for the full map, the required secrets, and the
guardrails.

## Deploying

Runs on **Cloudflare Workers** with the PDFs in a private **R2** bucket:

```bash
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler r2 bucket create bba-network-downloads
npx wrangler r2 bucket create bba-network-downloads-preview
npx wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY        # and the other secrets
npm run pdf:build && npm run pdf:upload
npm run cf:deploy
curl https://<worker-url>/api/health             # must report ok:true, backend:r2
```

Full instructions, costs and domain registration: **[docs/CLOUDFLARE.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE.md)**.

`npm run pdf:upload` is not optional — Workers has no filesystem, so skipping it
ships a store that takes money and then 500s on every download. `/api/health`
catches exactly that.

A Node host (Vercel, a container) also works unchanged: there the filesystem
fallback in `lib/storage.ts` is the live path, and `next.config.mjs` already bundles
`private/downloads/` with the download function.

See [docs/RUNBOOK.md](docs/RUNBOOK.md) for going live, [docs/CLOUDFLARE.md](docs/CLOUDFLARE.md)
for hosting, and [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) for why things are built this way.
