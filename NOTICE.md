## Font Awesome Free

Icons in `app/components/Icon.tsx` are from [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com)
and are licensed **CC BY 4.0**. Attribution is displayed in the site footer, as the
license requires.

Eleven glyphs are vendored as raw SVG paths rather than pulled from the npm package,
to keep the storefront dependency-free. The full set is cloned to
`vendor/Font-Awesome` by `npm run agents:bootstrap`.

## Vendored subagents

`.claude/agents/vendor/*.md` are generated from

rewritten, to the kebab-case identifier Claude Code expects; the content is upstream's.
